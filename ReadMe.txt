Hello, My name is Suhas Bacchu. This is my Database Appication for storing FBLA member information. This is a very simple to use application that can be used by any teacher, member or staff of the FBLA organization. There are no installations required.

    - The main information sheet is seen on the homepage. On the left side of the window are the buttons for basic functions and basic information about all the members in the organization
      Search        - To search for a member or a group of members with similar characteristics you have to enter information on the top of the home page and click on search. You do not have to enter the complete information of the member to find him/her. You can just enter the first letter of their first name and the program will list every member whose first name starts with that letter. Alos, you can you multiple information pieces for example, first letter of the first name and first two letters of last name etc. This is going to narrow the search.
